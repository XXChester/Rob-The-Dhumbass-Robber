	Objectives
============================
Entry into my first ever dev competition and it is the GameDev.net community weekend challenge starting May 12th at noon to May 16th at Noon. My plan is to get something in a playable
state by the end of the competition. I do not intend to place but rather just use this as a learning opportunity.

[]Put collision detection in with the walls		Wasted a mountain of time here trying to figure out a way to generate the bounding boxes on the fly
[*]Make guards patrol the halls
[*]Make the guards chase the player if he is seen
[*]Major bug with the AI walking through Non-walkable spaces
[*]Put in collision detection with each of the guards so they don't stack
