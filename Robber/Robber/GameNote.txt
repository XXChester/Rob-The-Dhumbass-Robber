============================
	Objectives
============================
Entry into my first ever dev competition and it is the GameDev.net community weekend challenge starting May 12th at noon to May 16th at Noon. My plan is to get something in a playable
state by the end of the competition. I do not intend to place but rather just use this as a learning opportunity.


============================
	Core(Phase 1)
============================
Raw version of the game functional with programmer art
[*]Planning
[*]Placeholder art
[*]Model objects
[]Make important models script accessible
[*]Render the board
[*]Render the player
[*]Make the player movable
[*]Change the image based on the direction the player is moving in
[*]Render the treasure
[*]Make the player able to catch the treasure
[*]Render guards
[*]Put collision detection in with the walls		Wasted a mountain of time here trying to figure out a way to generate the bounding boxes on the fly
[*]Make guards patrol the halls
[*]Make the guards chase the player if he is seen
[*]Major bug with the AI walking through Non-walkable spaces
[*]Put in collision detection with each of the guards so they don't stack
[*]Put in collision detection with the player
[*]Clean up AI so that it always walks down the middle of the square not the edge
[*]Clean up collision detection so that it doesn't bounch you around...instead you just don't move if it will result in a collision...provisional CD opposed to reaction CD
[*]Implement Player detection via radius
[]Make a HUD
[]Implement flow mechanism
[]Render main menu screen
[]Render in game menu screen


============================
	Polish(Phase 2)
============================
Replace the programmer art with real art and make the game not only maintain its functionality but also add a nice playable environment and add additional functionality
[]Fix up AI some more....can still walk through walls sometimes
[]Pause at waypoints
[]Screen fades in and out
[]Robber and guard sprites
[]Upgrade tile graphics
[]Add in garbage cans to hide in and clear agro**
[]Add in random sneezing if you stand within the same tile too long
[]Add in emote system when guards are chasing etc
[]Sfx
