============================
	Objectives
============================
Entry into my first ever dev competition and it is the GameDev.net community weekend challenge starting May 12th at noon to May 16th at Noon. My plan is to get something in a playable
state by the end of the competition. I do not intend to place but rather just use this as a learning opportunity.


============================
	Core(Phase 1)
============================
Raw version of the game functional with programmer art
[*]Planning
[*]Placeholder art
[*]Model objects
[*]Make important models script accessible
[*]Render the board
[*]Render the player
[*]Make the player movable
[*]Change the image based on the direction the player is moving in
[*]Render the treasure
[*]Make the player able to catch the treasure
[*]Render guards
[*]Put collision detection in with the walls		Wasted a mountain of time here trying to figure out a way to generate the bounding boxes on the fly
[*]Make guards patrol the halls
[*]Make the guards chase the player if he is seen
[*]Major bug with the AI walking through Non-walkable spaces
[*]Put in collision detection with each of the guards so they don't stack
[*]Put in collision detection with the player
[*]Clean up AI so that it always walks down the middle of the square not the edge
[*]Clean up collision detection so that it doesn't bounch you around...instead you just don't move if it will result in a collision...provisional CD opposed to reaction CD
[*]Implement Player detection via radius
[*]Make a HUD
[*]Implement flow mechanism
[*]Render main menu screen
[*]Render in game menu screen


============================
	Polish(Phase 2)
============================
Replace the programmer art with less crappy programmer art and make the game not only maintain its functionality but also add a nice playable environment and add additional functionality
[]Fix up AI some more....can still walk through walls sometimes
[]LOS Detection triangle
[]Make timer have decimal places
[*]Delay the start of the level so the user can have a look at the layout	***
[]Pause at waypoints				
[*]Screen fades in and out (Transitions)
[*]Robber and guard sprites
[*]Upgrade tile graphics
[]Add in garbage cans to hide in and clear agro**
[]Add in random sneezing if you stand within the same tile too long
[*]Add in emote system when guards are chasing etc
[*]Sfx emotes
[*]Sfx
[]Put doors in
[]Rotate idle sfxs
[]Multiple maps read from directory		-Hard coded at this time because I don't have time to figure out how to change the content pipeline, making it very easy to add maps though
	[*]Hard coded but very easy to add new ones		-Can create and map indentifiers for a new map in about 30minutes
[*]Map select screen
[*]Change sprite direction determination for up and down, base it on last direction

===========================
ISSUES
==========================
[]AI can sometimes walk through walls		--All the logic is correct it is just the AI is not walking down the middle of the square which it needs to
	[*]Cleaned uup a bit but needs another pass
[*]AI cannot get the player if they are against an outer wall
[]If you agro the AI with the new algorithm for their walking paths they will get stucks
[*]Clicking on the Return to Main button near where the Exit button spawns will exit the game....if I get to transitions that should fix the issue
[*]Radius detection bounding spehere is not computing correctly on the south/east side
[]Appears the sound API crashes the game sometimes with no stack trace or anything....appears to only be in debug mode
[*]Nasty flash when you loose and you hit replay			-caused by the reset() call
	[]Solving this makes the score reset to the levels time before the transition out, it was either this or a nasty flash...I think the flash was a lot worse
